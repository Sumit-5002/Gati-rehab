# Gati Rehab App - AI-Powered Virtual Rehabilitation Assistant

A premium Progressive Web Application (PWA) for remote physical therapy using state-of-the-art AI-powered pose detection and real-time clinical monitoring.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Gati is a sophisticated rehabilitation platform that transforms smartphone cameras into clinical-grade assessment tools. Using MediaPipe AI, it provides real-time biomechanical feedback, range-of-motion (ROM) tracking, and form quality scoring.

**Live Project**: `https://gati.web.app` (Production environment)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js + Vite (High-performance rendering)
- **Routing**: Centralized Route Configuration (React Router v7)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS + Tailwind (Modern Glassmorphism & Neural themes)
- **AI Engine**: MediaPipe Pose Landmarker (33 keypoints, 30+ FPS client-side)
- **Real-time DB**: Firebase Firestore (Real-time sync enabled)
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication (Multi-role support)
- **Analytics**: Recharts (Clinical trend visualization)
- **Offline**: Service Workers + LocalStorage sync architecture
- **Icons**: Lucide React (Premium stroke set)
